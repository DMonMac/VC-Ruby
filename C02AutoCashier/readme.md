### THE CHALLENGE  
> William runs a small resturant here in Baguio. He has been looking for ways to cut costs and has realised that his largest expense is Michael, his cashier. You are to use what you have learned to try and help William reduce the costs in his business.

If the user inputs a payment lesser than the required amount, the cashier will display the amount lacking and repeat the 4 options above for the user to choose from.

The 'Reduce' screen is similar to the 'Items' screen. The only difference is that instead of adding to the list, the user gets to reduce items from the list.

As with the 'Items' function, the user will be asked how many of a certain item should be reduced and if he/she would like to remove more items.
