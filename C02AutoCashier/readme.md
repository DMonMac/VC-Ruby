#### Reduce
The 'Reduce' screen is similar to the 'Items' screen. The only difference is that instead of adding to the list, the user gets to reduce items from the list.

As with the 'Items' function, the user will be asked how many of a certain item should be reduced and if he/she would like to remove more items.
