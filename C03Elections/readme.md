and the program will return to the initial screen after hitting 'Enter' again. Notice that above the list of candidates, 1 vote has been added in.

- #### Number of Votes
    This machine was designed to accept a maximum of 20 votes, meaning it's possible to end the voting process even if 20 votes aren't in yet. This is done by typing 'End' when asked for a name of a candidate to vote for.

- #### Ties
    Should there be a tie, the program will reset all votes and repeat the voting process until one of the candidates win.
