### THE CHALLENGE  
> The new country of Vivixx has decided to hold an election! They will be choosing their first ever president. With what you have learned, can you help them to help in the voting process?  
\
Candidates:  
Mika  
Reggie  
Kenneth  
Trevor  
\
Four candidates, 20 voters.

### THE PROGRAM
This program acts as a voting machine for the 'Vivixx Presidential Elections 2017'. Though we're really not voting for a president.  

#### LET'S VOTE!
So this is the screen that will greet you when you open the program:

The voter will get this message after voting:

and the program will return to the initial screen after hitting 'Enter' again. Notice that above the list of candidates, 1 vote has been added in.

- #### Number of Votes
    This machine was designed to accept a maximum of 20 votes, meaning it's possible to end the voting process even if 20 votes aren't in yet. This is done by typing 'End' when asked for a name of a candidate to vote for.

- #### Ties
    Should there be a tie, the program will reset all votes and repeat the voting process until one of the candidates win.
