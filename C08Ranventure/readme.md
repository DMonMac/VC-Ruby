### THE CHALLENGE  
> Write a program that will "IMPRESS ACE*".  
\
\* Basically, Ace Estrada is the one who started the Vivixx Bootcamp that I am able to be a part of. This is one of the programs presented in order to show him how much we've learned so far.

### THE PROGRAM
This is a "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure" game created using Ruby.

Here, the player will go through a scenario, and at the end of it, he/she will be able to choose the next scenario to go through. The ending could be a good one or a bad one. It all depends on the player's choices.

#### Let's Play!

#### Profile
The player begins with typing in a name:

Then age:

And, finally, where you live:

The next screen will display your full profile, and you will be given options to edit each one before starting the adventure (or, if you got bored already, exit the game).

#### The Story

For this session, let's decide to stay in bed (Type '2').

Well, that wasn't really a great ending wasn't it?

Of course, not all scenarios are this short (or sad). As an initial story database, there is one storyline where the player gets a pretty... 'acceptable' ending. So as to not spoil that, we leave it to you to try the game out yourself.

For now...

We hope you enjoy this little game we made!
