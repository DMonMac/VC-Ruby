### THE PROGRAM
This is a "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure" game created using Ruby.

Here, the player will go through a scenario, and at the end of it, he/she will be able to choose the next scenario to go through. The ending could be a good one or a bad one. It all depends on the player's choices.

#### Let's Play!
